  spec.description = <<~DESC
    blusher routes Ruby's rouge lexing — and, for the common HTML path, its
    formatting — through the Rust `carmine` engine, which executes rule tables
    extracted from rouge's own lexers. For an unadorned Rouge::Formatters::HTML
    pipeline it fuses lex+format in Rust and returns one String, crossing the
    Ruby boundary once instead of per-token: ~1.7x faster on a mixed corpus
    (2.5x+ on large files), byte-identical, with transparent fallback to rouge
    for callback lexers and other formatters. Verified against rouge's full
    lexer spec suite (757/757). The engine's raw 4.6x is realized Rust-to-Rust.
